#Regression Analysis (My opinion on each model's results) :

1- The linear regression model is displaying the predicted values of Y (salary) based on the independent variable X which is the Position level, so We got points that fit the straight line of the prediction model but it is still not predicting all values in an optimal way. 

2-	The Polynomial linear regression model results shows more logical predictions and the line of the prediction model has reached the outlier value, so it is better than the linear regression. 


3-	The SVR correctly predicts many values and there is many values has fit the prediction model line, but it does not reached the outlier point.
